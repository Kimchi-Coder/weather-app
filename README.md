# Little Weather App

A weather app to search the weather in a certain city around the world with a dynamic background based on that area's temperature.

## Things I Learned / Improved:

- Dynamic class names based on state
- Calling api, understanding its structure, and utilizing its data
- Designing for an app layout vs desktop

## Things to Improve For Future Projects:

- Modularize components so I can expand in the future
- More background images to account for more weather
- Make background image based on weather condition instead of temperature (ie. 'sunny,' 'rainy, 'snowy,' etc.)
- Combine functionality with another api such as PokeApi to make a pokemon appear based on the weather

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
